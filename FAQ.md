## Do the artist see any money from the crates or marketplace?

No. This is something Valve are working on. It's the reason "keys" exist in other games - which is not something we want in Rust.

## Some of the items from last week were removed from the store and added to the crates?

All skins have limited runs. Skins are removed when they've been around for a long time or have made too much money.

## If two artist reach the same idea ( which is likely ) and they have similar rates, how would you decide which one to add to the game?

Like everything, whichever is the best, whichever has the most votes, whichever is presented nicer. If one artist hasn't had an item approved before, we'd lean towards approving that artists work.

## There seems to be a lot of issues with copyrighted material, what is technically legal in these sense? 

It's a matter of opinion a lot of the time. We can't really tell you where the line is without seeing it, things have to be judged on a case by case basis.
